## Project Description

PN is a task management and productivity app. PN aims to accomplish two things: (1) allow users to focus on their work, without the distraction of their mobile devices and (2) provide a simple scheduling interface. To that end, PN utilizes an awards-based system to motivate users to stay in focus and complete all their designated tasks within the day.

The user starts by creating a to-do list for the day. Each task on the to-do list comes with a user-specified duration of time that they would like to allocate for that task. To incentivize the process, each task correlates with a sprite-like creature that you have to care for. With each task you complete, the creature will grow. Complete a large variety of tasks to populate your day care with more creatures! Once a task is started, leaving the app will terminate the creatureâ€™s growth and after too many terminations, the creature will leave.
